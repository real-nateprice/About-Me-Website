  <h2>My personal interests</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy music production as a hobby. I currently use reaper because it is technically free
    and has a great reputation among the music production community. You are told in the software
    that after 60 days you are to purchase a license for $60, but this is not enforeced. Thusfar
    I have been using it to make mashups of songs I like in order to familiarize myself with the
    software and workflow before introducing my own creative pursuits.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also enjoy playing various video games. Most of the games I had played until recently were 
    single player nintendo games, but lately I have ben playing the multiplayer games my friends
    want to play with me, as well as several single player games they have recommended. The game
    I am currently playing is called Cult of the Lamb.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope to get more into hobby coding. I have had fun with various personal projects in the
    past, but their scope was always rather limited by my inexperience. I would like to learn
    how to mess around with LLMs and other AI tools, both because of the topic's current relevance
    to the community and because I think it would be fun to experiment with.
